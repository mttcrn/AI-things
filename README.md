# AI-things
This repository contains all the Jupyter notebooks Iâ€™ve used during my university studies related to AI. 
The notebooks cover various topics, including:

- Machine Learning 
- Neural Networks & Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing 

These notebooks include coursework, experiments, and personal explorations in AI. They serve as a reference for learning, revisiting key concepts, and applying AI techniques to different problems.
