        "In order to identify the best hyperparameter settings for the regularization parameter of a model, we could test different values manually, or we can make use of a grid search with cross-validation module (called GridSearchCV) available in sklearn. The code doesn't need a validation set, but instead runs K-Fold Cross-Validation, which splits the training set up into k subsets, and iteratively uses k-1 of the folds for training and the remaining fold for valiation, before averaging the validation score across the k-folds. We'll set k=2 and try 3 different values for the hyperparmeter C."
